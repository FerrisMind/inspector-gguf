# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for adding comprehensive rustdoc documentation to the Inspector GGUF project. The goal is to create professional-grade API documentation that meets Rust community standards, enables successful docs.rs publication, and provides clear guidance for both library users and contributors.

## Glossary

- **Inspector GGUF**: A Rust application for analyzing GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) model files
- **rustdoc**: Rust's built-in documentation generation tool
- **docs.rs**: The official Rust documentation hosting service
- **Public API Surface**: All public functions, structs, enums, traits, and modules exposed by the crate
- **Intra-doc Links**: Cross-references within documentation using Rust's `[Type]` syntax
- **Doctest**: Executable code examples within documentation comments
- **Missing Docs Lint**: Rust compiler warning for undocumented public items

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Rust developer using Inspector GGUF as a library, I want comprehensive API documentation so that I can understand how to integrate GGUF parsing functionality into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo doc`, THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL generate complete HTML documentation without errors
2. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL include module-level documentation for all public modules using `//!` comments
3. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL document all public functions with `///` comments including purpose, arguments, examples, errors, and panics sections
4. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL provide working code examples in all function documentation that compile and execute successfully as doctests
5. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL use intra-doc links for cross-references between API elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a contributor to Inspector GGUF, I want enforced documentation standards so that the codebase maintains consistent and complete documentation coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL enable the `missing_docs` lint at the crate level using `#![warn(missing_docs)]`
2. WHEN building the project, THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL produce no missing documentation warnings for public API elements
3. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL hide internal implementation details using `#[doc(hidden)]` attributes where appropriate
4. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL structure documentation comments with consistent Markdown sections (Arguments, Examples, Errors, Panics)
5. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL include necessary imports in all documentation examples

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Rust ecosystem user, I want Inspector GGUF documentation available on docs.rs so that I can access it through the standard Rust documentation portal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL configure `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` in Cargo.toml with `all-features = true`
2. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL include `rustdoc-args = ["--cfg", "docsrs"]` for conditional documentation features
3. WHEN published to crates.io, THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL build successfully on docs.rs with complete feature coverage
4. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL mark platform-specific or feature-gated APIs with appropriate `cfg` attributes
5. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL resolve all intra-doc links correctly in the docs.rs environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer learning GGUF file processing, I want practical code examples in the documentation so that I can understand real-world usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL include comprehensive examples in the crate-level documentation showing basic usage
2. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL provide working examples for all major API functions that demonstrate realistic use cases
3. WHEN I run `cargo test --doc`, THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL execute all documentation examples successfully
4. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL include assertions in documentation examples to verify expected behavior
5. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL cover error handling patterns in documentation examples

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer of Inspector GGUF, I want automated documentation validation so that documentation quality is maintained over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL pass `cargo doc --no-deps` without warnings or errors
2. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL pass `cargo test --doc` with all doctests executing successfully
3. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL validate that all intra-doc links resolve correctly during documentation generation
4. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL include documentation coverage for all public modules: format, gui, localization, and versioning
5. THE Inspector GGUF crate SHALL maintain documentation that builds successfully with both local and docs.rs configurations
