# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the large `gui.rs` file (1300+ lines) into smaller, more maintainable modules. The refactoring aims to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability while ensuring no functionality is lost.

## Glossary

- **GUI_Module**: The main graphical user interface module containing the application logic
- **Theme_System**: The visual styling and theming functionality for the application
- **Export_System**: The functionality for exporting metadata to various file formats
- **Layout_System**: The adaptive layout and sizing functionality for different screen sizes
- **File_Loader**: The asynchronous file loading and processing functionality
- **Update_Checker**: The system for checking application updates from GitHub
- **Panel_Manager**: The system for managing different UI panels (sidebar, content, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GUI code to be organized into logical modules, so that I can easily find and maintain specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Module SHALL be split into separate modules with no single module exceeding 200 lines of code
2. WHEN organizing modules, THE GUI_Module SHALL maintain all existing functionality without regression
3. THE GUI_Module SHALL use proper Rust module structure with clear public interfaces
4. THE GUI_Module SHALL maintain existing import dependencies and external crate usage
5. THE GUI_Module SHALL preserve all existing type definitions and constants

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want theme-related functionality separated from the main GUI logic, so that I can modify styling independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Theme_System SHALL contain all color constants and theme application logic
2. THE Theme_System SHALL include adaptive font sizing and layout scaling functions
3. THE Theme_System SHALL provide a clean interface for applying themes to the GUI context
4. THE Theme_System SHALL maintain the Inspector Gadget color palette and styling
5. THE Theme_System SHALL be contained in a module not exceeding 200 lines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want export functionality isolated in its own module, so that I can add new export formats without affecting other code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Export_System SHALL contain all export functions for different file formats (CSV, YAML, Markdown, HTML, PDF)
2. THE Export_System SHALL include utility functions for file path handling and content sanitization
3. THE Export_System SHALL provide a consistent interface for all export operations
4. THE Export_System SHALL handle error cases and file extension management
5. THE Export_System SHALL be contained in a module not exceeding 200 lines

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file loading logic separated from UI rendering, so that I can modify loading behavior independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE File_Loader SHALL contain the asynchronous GGUF file loading functionality
2. THE File_Loader SHALL manage progress tracking and result handling
3. THE File_Loader SHALL include metadata processing and parsing logic
4. THE File_Loader SHALL handle file reading, error cases, and progress updates
5. THE File_Loader SHALL be contained in a module not exceeding 200 lines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI panel management separated from the main application logic, so that I can modify panel behavior independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Panel_Manager SHALL contain logic for rendering different UI panels (sidebar, content panels, dialogs)
2. THE Panel_Manager SHALL manage panel state and interactions
3. THE Panel_Manager SHALL handle adaptive panel sizing and layout
4. THE Panel_Manager SHALL provide methods for showing/hiding different panels
5. THE Panel_Manager SHALL be contained in modules not exceeding 200 lines each

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want update checking functionality isolated, so that I can modify version checking without affecting other features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Update_Checker SHALL contain GitHub API integration for version checking
2. THE Update_Checker SHALL handle version comparison and update status management
3. THE Update_Checker SHALL provide error handling for network and API failures
4. THE Update_Checker SHALL be contained in a module not exceeding 200 lines
5. THE Update_Checker SHALL maintain existing update checking behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main GUI module to be a clean orchestrator, so that the application structure is clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Module main file SHALL primarily contain the GgufApp struct and eframe::App implementation
2. THE GUI_Module main file SHALL coordinate between different subsystem modules
3. THE GUI_Module main file SHALL not exceed 200 lines of code
4. THE GUI_Module SHALL maintain all existing public interfaces and functionality
5. THE GUI_Module SHALL use proper module imports and re-exports as needed
